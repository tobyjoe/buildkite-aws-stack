# Buildkite AWS Stack

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/d178ab942e2f606a83e79847704648437d82a9c5fdb434b7ae.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/buildkite-aws-stack/buildkite-aws-stack)

Create an auto-scaling build cluster on AWS/VPC in under 10 minutes. Designed to support multiple different projects sharing a single stack and isolated builds of third-party pull-requests.

## Getting Started

The easiest way is to launch the latest built version via this button:

[![Launch Buildkite AWS Stack](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/cloudformation-launch-stack-button.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=buildkite&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildkite-aws-stack/aws-stack.json)

If you'd like to use the CLI, clone this repo and then run the below command to create a new stack.

```bash
make && make create-stack
```

Check out [`buildkite-elastic.yml`](templates/buildkite-elastic.yml) for more details.

## Targeting Builds

Set your [Agent Query Rules](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/agent-meta-data) to `queue=elastic`, or to whatever `BuildkiteQueue` you provided to your stack.

## Secrets

Your stack has access to the `SecretsBucket` parameter you passed in. This should be used in combination with server-side object encryption to ensure that your CI secrets (such as Github credentials) are reasonably secure. See the [Security](#security) section for more details.

Two files are specifically looked for, `id_rsa_github`, for checking out your git code and optionally `env`, which contains environment variables to expose to the job command.

By default, builds will look for `s3://{SecretsBucket}/{PipelineSlug}/filename`.  You can override the `{PipelineSlug}` part with the `BUILDKITE_SECRETS_PREFIX` environment variable.

You should encrypt your objects with a project-specific key and provide it in `BUILDKITE_SECRETS_KEY` which will be used to decrypt all the files found in the secrets bucket.

### Creating a new project

```bash
# generate a deploy key for your project
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa_github
pbcopy < id_rsa_github.pub # paste this into your github deploy key

# upload the private key, encrypted
PASSPHRASE=$(head -c 24  /dev/urandom | base64)
aws s3 cp --acl private --sse-c --sse-c-key "$PASSPHRASE" id_rsa_github "s3://my-provision-bucket/myproject/id_rsa_github"
pbcopy <<< "$PASSPHRASE" # paste passphrase into buildkite env as BUILDKITE_SECRETS_KEY

# cleanup
unset PASSPHRASE
rm id_rsa_github*
```

For Docker Hub credentials, you can use `DOCKER_HUB_USER`, `DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD` and `DOCKER_HUB_EMAIL` in your `env` file.

## Autoscaling

If you provided a `BuildkiteApiAccessToken`, a Buildkite API token with `read_builds` and `read_agents` permissions across your organization, then build and job metrics will be collected for your queue and used to scale your cluster of agents. Autoscaling is designed to scale up quite quickly and then gradually scale down. See [the autoscale.yml template](templates/autoscale.yml) for more details, or the [Buildkite Metrics Publisher](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-cloudwatch-metrics-publisher) project for how metrics are collected.

## Security

This repository hasn't been reviewed by security researchers, so exercise caution and careful thought with what credentials you make available to your builds. At present anyone with access to your CI machines or commit access to your codebase (including third-party pull-requests) will theoretically have access to your encrypted secrets. Anyone with access to your Buildkite Project Configuration will be able to retrieve the encryption key used to decrypt these. In combination, the attacker would have access to your decrypted secrets.

Presently the EC2 Metadata instance is available via HTTP request from builds, which means that builds have the same IAM access as the basic build host does.

## Questions?

This is experimental and still being actively developed, but under heavy use at 99designs.
